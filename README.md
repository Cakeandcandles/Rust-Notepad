This is a very minimal, yet powerful note-taking/writing app I designed for my desktop. It's features include being able to create, save, and load plain text files - completely powered by Rust and the egui framework. 
Another feature is the optional file picker toggle, wich is a personal favorite- it gives you the option to simply have a folder created wich will store all of your text files automatically, or you can toggle it on and manually 
choose where you'd like your file to go. To use, just make sure you have rust and cargo installed, and clone and run with cargo run (or cargo run --release if you plan on saving the executable).
